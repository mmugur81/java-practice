Youâ€™ll need to base your calculation on the following facts:


    Seven Kingdom practice.Army:
    - {no_of_dragons} Dragons, each one has 600 damage and 600 defence
    - 5000 practice.Infantry, each one has 2 damage and 2 defence

    White Walker practice.Army:
    - {no_of_white_lords} White Lords, each one has 50 damage and 100 defence
    - 10000 Walkers practice.Infantry, each one has 1 damage and 3 defence

    The attacker cannot have passive units (units which are not attacking in one turn)

    One unit cannot remain with unconsumed damage as long as there are still enemies remaining

    Each attacking unit can strike multiple defenders in the same turn until its damage is consumed

    When an attacking unit is striking, its damage is reduced in the current turn with the defense value of the defender

    The turn ends when the cumulated damage of the attacker reaches 0

    After an attack, the defenders which are not killed (defence > 0) will replenish their defence to 100%

    Find the fastest way to victory, no matter which team wins

Example: A practice.Dragon (600 damage) attacks a White Lord (defence 100)


    The practice.Dragon has 500 damage remaining and can strike 5 more White Lords in the same turn

    The White Lord dies

How long will the battle last (how many turns) and who will emerge victorious?
